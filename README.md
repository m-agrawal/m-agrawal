- 👋 Hi, I’m Mohit Agrawal.
- 👀 I have worked on multiple major policy initiatives at the state and local levels in Connecticut. I'm currently conducting research in labor and health economics to better understand how policy shapes human capital.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about state development, especially in the context of the 75th anniversary of Indian and Pakistani independence.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research and policy – hit me up!
- 📫 Reach me at mohit.agrawal "at" yale.edu.
